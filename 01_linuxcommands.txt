                                                              ==================================

pwd
***
Use the pwd command to find out the path of the current working directory (folder) you’re in. The command will return an absolute (full) path, which is basically a path of all the directories that starts with a forward slash (/).
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/S4CSE$ pwd
               /home/albin/osalbin/S4CSE

ls
**
The ls command is used to view the contents of a directory. By default, this command will display the contents of your current working directory.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ ls
               a.out  fcfs.c  priority.c  S4CSE  sjf.c
• ls -R will list all the files in the sub-directories as well
   Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ ls -R
                   .:
                   a.out  fcfs.c  priority.c  S4CSE  sjf.c

                   ./S4CSE:
• ls -a will show the hidden files
   Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ ls -a
                  .  ..  a.out  fcfs.c  priority.c  S4CSE  sjf.c
• ls -al will list the files and directories with detailed information like the permissions, size, owner,                       etc...
   Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ ls -al
                  total 40
                  drwxrwxr-x  3 albin albin  4096 May  2 20:00 .
                  drwxr-x--- 18 albin albin  4096 May  2 19:56 ..
                  -rwxrwxr-x  1 albin albin 16160 Apr 22 21:20 a.out
                  -rw-rw-r--  1 albin albin  2537 Apr 22 20:23 fcfs.c
                  -rw-rw-r--  1 albin albin  1362 Apr 22 21:20 priority.c
                  drwxrwxr-x  2 albin albin  4096 May  2 20:00 S4CSE
                  -rw-rw-r--  1 albin albin  2088 Apr 22 20:35 sjf.c

mkdir
*****
Use mkdir command to make a new directory
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ mkdir S4CSE

rmdir
*****
If you need to delete a directory, use the rmdir command. However, rmdir only allows you to delete empty directories.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ rmdir S4CSE
                albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ ls
                a.out  fcfs.c  priority.c  sjf.c
                
cd
**
If you need to change the working directory, use the cd command.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ cd S4CSE

mv
**
If you need to transfer a file from one directory to another or to change the name of a file, use mv command.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ mv student.txt \Batch2021
               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ cd Batch
               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ ls
               student.txt

cat
***
cat (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands in
Linux. It is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output.
Here are other ways to use the cat command:
• cat > filename creates a new file
   Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cat >studentz.txt
                  Albin
                  Alen
                  Anandhu
                  ^C
• cat filename1 filename2>filename3 joins two files (1 and 2) and stores the
   output of them in a new file (3)
   Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cat studentz.txt students.txt >student.txt
                                               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cat student.txt
                                               Albin
                                               Alen
                                               Anandhu
                                               Joyal
                                               Arjun
                                               Abhiram
                                               Rejith
• to convert a file to upper or lower case use, cat filename | tr a-z A-Z
>output.txt
  Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cat student.txt|tr A-Z a-z>output.txt
                 albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cat output.txt
                 albin
                 alen
                 anandhu
                 joyal
                 arjun
                 abhiram
                 rejith

cp
**
Use the cp command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory or make a copy of file with different name in the working directory.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cp student.txt result.txt
               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin/Batch2021$ cat result.txt
               Albin
               Alen
               Anandhu
               Joyal
               Arjun
               Abhiram
               Rejith
rm
**
The rm command is used to delete files or directories and the contents within them.
rm -r <directory> will delete the directory even if it is not empty.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ rm -r Batch2021

locate
******
You can use this command to locate a file.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ locate student.txt
               home/sem4/student.txt

grep
****
It will search for the string in the file.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ cat student.txt
               albin
               alen
               anandhu
               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ grep -i "albin" student.txt
               albin

head
****
The head command is used to view the first lines of any text file. By default, it
will show the first ten lines, but you can change this number to your liking. For
example, if you only want to show the first five lines, type head -n 5
filename.ext.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ head -2 student.txt
               albin
               alen

tail
****
This one has a similar function to the head command, but instead of showing the first lines, the tail command will display the last ten lines of a text file. For example, tail -n 3 filename.ext will show last three lines.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ tail -2 student.txt
               alen
               anandhu

diff
****
Short for difference, the diff command compares the contents of two files line by line. After analyzing the files, it will output the lines that do not match.
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ cat a.txt
               aaa
               bbb
               ccc
               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ cat b.txt
               aaa
               bbb
               ddd
               albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ diff a.txt b.txt
               3c3
               < ccc
               ---
               > ddd

history
*******
Review the commands you’ve entered before .
Example:albin@albin-Lap:~/osalbin$ history
               1  gedit a.txt
               2 gedit b.txt
               3  cat a.txt
               4  cat b.txt
               5  diff a.txt b.txt
               6  history
